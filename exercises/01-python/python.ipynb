    "## 1. Basic Data Types\n",
    "As any other programming language, Python has several of built-in data types, which fall into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* String Type: `str`\n",
    "* Numeric Types: `int, float, complex`\n",
    "* Sequence Types: `list, tuple, range`\n",
    "* Mapping Type: `dict`\n",
    "* Set Types: `set, frozenset`\n",
    "* Boolean Type: `bool`\n",
    "* Binary Types: `bytes, bytearray, memoryview`\n",
    "* None Type: `NoneType`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the data type is inferred at run-time and can be changed during run-time. This means you do not need to specify for each variable its data type. When  you assign a value to a variable, Python inferrs the data-type and assigns it to the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the data type of any object by using the `type()` function. Execute the cell below to see some examples\n"

This is also the case if the object class needs to be initialized with parameters provided by the user (a program). In that case, the function is overriden by creating an __init__ function with the following signature __init__ (self, param1, param2, ...). Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "## 6. Modules\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are useful tools that allow for rapid testing and prototyping. However, once you have developed a stable set of methods it is worth to create your own modules which can be used by other files/programs without the need to write again all functions, objects, values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows this through the use of modules. Modules are ways to better structure code without the need to write everything in a single too long file, with the risk to waste time in searching for a specific function or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a module, it is sufficient to create a file with whatever you want inside (functions, classes, values, ...) and then save it with the module name you want using the .py extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module, it is necessary to import it. This is achieved through the command `import`. It is also possible to import only some variables or functions.\n",
