# Part 1: Linear Regression

In this part of the lab, you will get familiar with the practical use of the linear regression and you will implement your first learning pipeline. 

### Learning goals

After running this notebook, you should be able to:

1. Interpret the coefficent estimates produced by a linear model
2. Be familiar with the use of polynomial and categorical features
3. Be familiar with the building blocks of a pipeline to make building, fitting, and tracking models easier
4. Be able to make an informed choice of model based on the data at hand

### Hands-On
Open the [Linear Regression Jupyter notebook](./linear.ipynb) and start working on the required tasks.
